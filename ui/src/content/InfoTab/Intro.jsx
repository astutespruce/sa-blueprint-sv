        The South Atlantic Conservation Blueprint is a living spatial plan to
        conserve natural and cultural resources for future generations. It
        prioritizes the lands and waters of the South Atlantic based on the
        current condition of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine indicators.
        Through a connectivity analysis, it also identifies important hubs and
        corridors. More than 700 people from over 200 different organizations
        have participated in its development so far.
