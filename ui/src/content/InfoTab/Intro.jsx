        The South Atlantic Conservation Blueprint is a living spatial plan to
        conserve natural and cultural resources for future generations. It
        identifies shared conservation priorities across the South Atlantic
        region.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Blueprint is a data-driven plan based on terrestrial, freshwater,
        and marine indicators. It uses the current condition of those indicators
        to prioritize the most important areas for natural and cultural
        resources across the South Atlantic geography.
