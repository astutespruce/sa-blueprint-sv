<h2 id="About">About the Blueprint</h2>

<p>
    The Conservation Blueprint is a living spatial plan to conserve natural and
    cultural resources for future generations. Blueprint 2.2, released in November
    2017, is a totally data-driven plan based on terrestrial, freshwater, and marine,
    indicators. These indicators are intended to capture both the natural and cultural resource
    components of ecosystem integrity.  The Blueprint uses the current condition of those
    indicators to prioritize the most important areas for natural and cultural
    resources across the South Atlantic geography. Through a connectivity analysis,
    the Blueprint also identifies corridors that link coastal and inland areas and
    span climate gradients. The Blueprint reflects extensive feedback from the
    broader cooperative community, with more than 600 people from over 180 different
    organizations actively participating in its development so far.
