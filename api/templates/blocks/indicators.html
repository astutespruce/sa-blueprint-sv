<h2 id="Indicators">Indicators</h2>

<p>
    The indicators are the data building blocks of the Blueprint. They also
    serve as shared metrics of success for conservation in the South Atlantic.
    They are intended to capture both the natural and cultural resource
    components of ecosystem integrity. Ecosystem-specific indicators only apply
    within one distinct ecosystem. Cross-ecosystem indicators cover multiple
    ecosystems and capture the connections across terrestrial and aquatic
    systems.
    <br/><br/>
    The following tables summarize all the indicator values in this subwatershed.
    For some indicators, you’ll also see a threshold for good condition to help you
    interpret the indicator values. These thresholds are based on the best available
    science and reflect the range of indicator values that occur in healthy,
    functioning ecosystems. The good condition thresholds were initially defined in
    the <a href="http://www.southatlanticlcc.org/state-of-the-south-atlantic/">State of the South Atlantic 2015</a>.
    This report card measured the current condition of the indicators and used
    the thresholds to score the health of the region’s ecosystems. While good
    condition thresholds have not yet been defined for all indicators, all the
    indicators are used in the Blueprint.
